# Change_CovFun
change point detection and estimation procedures for the covariance kernel of functional data based on the norms of a generally weighted process of partial sample estimates.

We consider the objective data observations: $X_1(t), \dots, X_N(t)$, $t\in[0,1]$, where each functional observation $X_i(t)$ is a stochastic process with sample path in $L^2([0,1])$. The sequence $X_i(t)$ is assumed to follow the Data Generating Process: $X_i(t)= \mu(t)+\eps_i(t)$.
