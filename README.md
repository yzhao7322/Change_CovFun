# Change_CovFun
change point detection and estimation procedures for the covariance kernel of functional data based on the norms of a generally weighted process of partial sample estimates.

Reference: Change point analysis of covariance functions: a weighted cumulative sum approach, L. Horvath, G. Rice, Y. Zhao (2022) Journal of Multivariate Analysis.

We consider the objective data observations: $X_1(t), \dots, X_N(t)$
